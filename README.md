Machine learning and computer vision project

Developed Python machine learning models that take a picture of a fridge, identifies regions of interest, classifies images of ingredients with 92% accuracy, and suggests potential recipes to the user based on those ingredients

Built using RCNN for region proposal, transfer learning with ResNet and MobileNet, Tensorflow, Spoonacular API
